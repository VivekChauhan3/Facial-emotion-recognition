## Installation

To install the Facial Emotion Recognition project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python installation).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Facial-Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.**
    ```bash
   python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Required Packages: Install the necessary libraries using pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Download the Pre-trained Model: If your project includes a pre-trained model, ensure to download and place it in the specified directory.**
