# Facial Emotion Recognition Project

## Overview

This project implements a Facial Emotion Recognition system using deep learning techniques to analyze and classify emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a curated dataset and can detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and more, enhancing human-computer interaction.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Accurately classify emotions from facial images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for predictions.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Detect emotions in real-time using a webcam.

## Installation

To install the Facial Emotion Recognition project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- **pip**: Python package installer (usually comes with Python installation).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Facial-Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd Facial-Emotion-Recognition
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.**
    ```bash
   python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Required Packages: Install the necessary libraries using pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Download the Pre-trained Model: If your project includes a pre-trained model, ensure to download and place it in the specified directory.**

## Usage

1. **Run the Emotion Recognition Script**: After installation, you can run the script to start emotion recognition.
   ```bash
   python emotion_recognition.py
2. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**: The program will prompt you to allow access to your webcam for real-time emotion detection.
